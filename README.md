# AssaultCubeTrainerV3
This uses an external GLFW overlay to display ImGui, not needing a hook or being internal. This is V3 of my external Assault Cube Trainers.. It has features like Give Ammo, Armor, etc. I will add godmode later. I might make a V4 once I figure out how the heck to hook OpenGL and make an internal GUI.
Press insert to toggle the UI's visibility.
# How To Use
Open Assault Cube BEFORE opening the trainer. Then open the exe file, and the ImGui should show up. Now you can give yourself grenades and such, and when your done press insert. You can always press insert again to make the ImGui reappear. When you want to stop using the hack, use the Exit button and THEN close Assault Cube.
I will probably make something similiar for CSGO that has glow esp, fov changer, aimbot etc.
