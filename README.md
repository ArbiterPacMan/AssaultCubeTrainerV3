# AssaultCubeTrainerV3
This uses an external GLFW overlay to display ImGui, not needing a hook or being internal. This is V3 of my external Assault Cube Trainers.. It has features like Give Ammo, Armor, etc. I will add godmode later. I might make a V4 once I figure out how the heck to hook OpenGL and make an internal GUI.
